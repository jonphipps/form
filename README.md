Forms is a form builder app for the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/).
Admins can create forms by adding fields, assigning validation rules, and
selecting form handling "actions", then embed them into web pages through
the Dynamic Objects dialog.

> Note: Requires Elefant 1.1+ (on master branch)
